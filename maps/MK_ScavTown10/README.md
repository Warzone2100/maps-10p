Oil: low (10 or 16 in players bases)
Recommended Start settings: Ultimate Scavengers + Advanced bases + Technology from T1 

The Scavengers have many "High End Weapons": Scourge- and Pulse Laser Hardpoint,  Missile- and Mass Driver Fortress and some ranged weapons: Ripple Rocket, Hellstorm- and Archangel-Emplacement with CB-Towers! in the middle of the map. I have only tested in single player skirmish. You can play in (different) team or alone against all (at first no direct neighbors come by, except with hover).

10 player-version: 5 vs 5 | 4 vs 2 vs 4 | ...
- 10x oil per Player on edge: 6x safe oil in base, 4x UNSAFE oil near the base
- 16x oil per Player in middle (left & right base): 12x safe oil in base, 4x "unsafe" oil near the base
- 64x oil by Scavs: 8x4 Oil in "little" bases and 8x4 Oil in centre = 64
